							<h2>What is it?</h2>
							<p align="left">People of color essentially means anybody who is not White or from a European heritage or doesn't identify themselves in this racial category.
							   Since it has been use more to describe people who aren't racially white, this makes our society feel more of a threat. From the artifacts that
							   I have analyze before, all three artifacts have discuss of the term being a growing problem. Since the negativity of the term has an impact in 
							   our society, the three artifacts talk about different situations where "people of color" are attacked because of their race. Below you will 
							   find the three artifacts that I have analyze this quarter.

							<h2>Why are we talking about People of Color?</h2>
							<p align="left">In my English class, we are discussing about different terms that deals with racial and social issues that America is facing. Specifically, I 
								have chosen the topic of "people of color" because I, myself, am someone who identifies as a person of color. Growing up, I have always been 
								surrounded by people of color until coming into high school where it was a predominately White school. I think it is a great way to show an 
								identification of who we are and what our culture is.

			<h2> What do I think about the term? </h2>
				<p align="left">
					People of color has been a word that has been around for centuries dating back to when slavery will still an acceptable act in our country.
					Currently, it is more used as a negative term than a positive connation. When I see people use the term, it is an act of unification. This 
					is a time where many people may either feel excluded from society or unifying the country together. Whichever one it is, we can see a divde
					in how our world feels about racial and/or social topics.

							<h2>Artifacts</h2>
							<p align="left">The buildup to this major paper allowed me to analyze three different documents to discuss more about people of color. All three artifacts
							   discusses the troubles of people who are "colored" and the actions taken against them. What I want to emphasize more is that all three artifacts are 
							   able to tell the ways the term is able to change from one time period to the next generation and how each artifacts are using it to show 
							   identification and unification. Readers should understand that "people of color" may not be a positive nor negative term that we should associate with.
							   However, I think that these artifacts will show you the depth of history the term has grown but to let you know that

										The Journey From 'Colored' To 'Minorities' To 'People Of Color' discusses about the term "People of Color" and how it manifests into today society. In summary of the article,
										it highlights the idea of people of color with historical facts and many different anecdotes. She emphasizes that the term has had a long history where it was used during 
										slavery or even during the times of Martin Luther King Jr. However, her main point was how the term "people of color" transform into other different versions of words. It was 
										first said as "colored," then still used today as "people of color," but lastly, "minority." In the article, Kee Malesky points out that the word "colored" has a better positive 
										vibe than actually being called "Black." That statement is what I believe is true since when calling someone by their race seems way more inappropiate than calling someone 
										"colored." However, some may argue that they want to be known for their color and be called "Black, Asian, Hispanic, etc." and this is what the term "people of color" can have 
										for many people. They want to be identified and be known for who they are which is special and reassuring that they want others to acknowledge their backgrounds and culture since
										it is something people are proud of. For me, I agree with this because I want people to see that I am an Asian American man and not someone who is just a "colored" person. Being 
										called "colored" is very broad and not specifying or describe who I am as a person which is something I do not agree with. Lastly, she gives a small anecdote about what she learned
										in an art class when she was younger since she was taught that color crayons were the term shouldn't exist or that it is irrelevant to the subject. Her argument is something I want
										to point out because I believe bringing up the term show a division in our society which doesn't help unity. The term not only disregards this theme of being together but it is 
										counterargues that the word is not what we should care about but being together. Although this argument sound valid, I think the term "person of color" can necessarily be a good 
										thing since it helps us become different from others, allowing us to become an individual with custom cultures and backgrounds which very much disagrees with Malesky.

										A song by A Tribe Called Quest called "We the People" formulates an argument about Donald Trump's political compaign and how his future presidency will devastate the country and
										for many people of color and minority groups. I chose this artifact because it describes which people of color are affected greatly by it and what kind of problems have been 
										conflicted against them. Another factor is that within the song there are different ways people of color are being attack, therefore, I want to highlight the way "people of color"
										is manifested and used. When looking at RapGenius interpretation of the song, the chorus displayed various forms of minority groups attacked by Trump. <br><br>
										"All you Black folks, you must go/ <br>
										All you Mexicans, you must go/ <br>
										And all you poor folks, you must go/ <br>
										Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways/
										So all you bad folks, you must go" <br><br>
										When I see and hear this chorus from the song, I think a lot back to when there are different stereotypes or hate towards an ethnicity. When I grew up in a diverse neighborhood
										you don't see much of a division among different racial groups because you can see the differences that lies between each other but still continue to intermingle with everybody
										in the community. However, in the song you have such a divide that many people of color don't see the same way as White people do. And that's where you may see the opposite of 
										what other artifacts talk about which is unity. In many cases, when we talk about people of color there is a sense of unity among all people, on the other hand, the song shows 
										that not everybody is together and now the minority groups is fending off against one racial group, or more specifically, against Donald Trump. In otherwords, I agree with the 
										interpretation of what RapGenius has about the chorus on oppression and hate against those of minority groups.

										Seattle Time's Under Our Skin Project which highlights different racial and social terms that must be discuss in our current generation. This artifact is what made me write and 
										publish this website. The project discusses thirteen different racial/social terms that targets a problem in our society. Since people of color is one of the term that I want to 
										expand on, I would like to point out that people of color represents those who aren't white. In relations with the other terms, you can see that people of color could have a 
										significant connection to all the other term. For example, white privilege are those whom are racially born white and are significantly better off themselves compare to what 
										those who are not white have when they were born, whether in the country or internationally. That's only one example. In the video for the term "people of color," many believe that
										the term has a feeling of disempowerment and disadvantages when being called a "minority" or a "person of color." It feels as though people want to avoid the topic of calling others
										"Black" because they don't want to come as offensive or disrespectful the someone's race. I find this statement true because it is the same way when you see an Asian person and 
										asking if they are really Asian or what their ethnicity is. Strangers don't want to question it because they don't want to seem rude or not being able to identify who you are 
										culturally. The project also identifies that the term can also be a political factor. When you are somewhere in an eastern city such as D.C. or Atlanta you can be known as Black but
										in a more liberal city such as Seattle or such, you have to be aware of what term/word you use and the context it is in. I think that this is a problem that people struggle 
										what is best used in the environment they are in. This is why many use "person of color" to generalized the topic and not see it as an identification. Following that explanation, 
										this is why this is part of the artifact I have chose to interpret because this artifact along with the other two exemplifies how racial identity in different social environment
										is more challenging than people realize. You don't want to identify yourself as a "person of color" because you may feel attacked but you also want to do it because it makes you feel
										proud of who you are as a person. And I think that's the biggest struggle many people of color face.

						<h2>What do these artifacts mean to people of color?</h2>
							<p align="left">
								I believe that the term person of color reflects the society and how people see themselves as. What I mean by that is what do people think about us in their point of view and how do we see 
								ourselves. The term personally shows identification. When the term is used, many people want to show others who they are whether that means from their backgrounds, color of their skin, etc.
								When I use it I want others to know that the term person of color is not always use in a positive environment but it isn't necessarily a negative word because of it's connotation. So how do 
								these artifacts relate or differ when talking about "people of color?" First, they all have one definition when defining "person of color" and that is anybody who is not racially White. 
								Another fact is that they all show how different the term manifest into a different term and how those who represent the term are being conflicted in different aspects of racial or social 
								problems. In conclusion, "person of color" is a term used as an indentification. When I someone announces themself as being a "person of color," it sets themselves apart to show that they are
								different from others. What I mean by this is that they want others to know that "colored" isn't the right word to be described and that they want everybody to know who they are culturally.
